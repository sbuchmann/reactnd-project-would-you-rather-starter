# Would You Rather Project

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
